COMMAND CENTER — GENERALIZED HANDOFF SPECIFICATION
For agents building a Command Center page on any platform
=============================================================================

WHAT IT IS
----------
The Command Center is a PIN-protected central dashboard that serves as the 
single entry point for ALL administrative, management, and operational tools 
across the entire platform. It replaces the need for scattered admin pages 
by organizing every tool, feature, and management page into categorized, 
visually rich card-based sections. Think of it as "mission control" — one 
page where the owner/admin can launch into any part of the system.

It does NOT need to be called "Command Center" or "Team Portal" — it can 
be branded however the platform wants. The key is that it's the protected 
hub where authorized users access everything.

=============================================================================

WHAT IT DOES
------------
1. AUTHENTICATES the user (PIN-based login, password, or other auth method)
2. ORGANIZES every tool/page into logical CATEGORIES
3. PRESENTS each tool as a visually rich CARD with:
   - Label (tool name)
   - Description (what it does, one line)
   - Link (where it goes)
   - Icon (relevant Lucide icon)
   - Background image (photorealistic, subject-matter relevant)
   - Glow color (colored shadow matching the category theme)
   - Optional badge (e.g., "Live", "New", "Earn", "Beta")
   - Optional "featured" flag (makes the card larger/more prominent)
4. GROUPS cards into horizontally-scrollable CAROUSELS per category
5. PROVIDES a sticky top navigation bar with branding and logout
6. SUPPORTS category-level descriptions explaining what each section covers

=============================================================================

CATEGORY STRUCTURE
------------------
Categories should be defined based on the platform's domain. Each category 
needs:

  {
    title: "Category Name",
    icon: <LucideIcon />,
    gradient: "from-{color}-500 to-{color}-500",  // Tailwind gradient
    description: "2-3 sentence description of what this category covers 
                  and why the user would go here.",
    cards: [ ...array of LaunchCard objects ]
  }

EXAMPLE CATEGORIES (adapt to your platform's subject matter):
  - Operations / Core Tools
  - Users / Customers / Members
  - Content / Marketing / Communications
  - Analytics / Reports
  - Settings / Account / Team
  - Developer / Technical Tools
  - Finance / Billing
  - Integrations / Ecosystem

Each platform should have 4-10 categories depending on complexity.

=============================================================================

CARD DATA MODEL
---------------
Each card (LaunchCard) in a category follows this structure:

  interface LaunchCard {
    label: string;          // Tool name, e.g., "Order Manager"
    description: string;    // One-line description, e.g., "View and manage all orders"
    href: string;           // Route to navigate to, e.g., "/admin/orders"
    icon: React.ReactNode;  // Lucide icon component, e.g., <ShoppingCart />
    image: string;          // Imported photorealistic background image
    glowColor: string;      // Tailwind shadow class, e.g., "shadow-orange-500/20"
    badge?: string;         // Optional badge text, e.g., "Live", "New", "Beta"
    featured?: boolean;     // If true, card gets extra visual prominence
  }

=============================================================================

UI DESIGN SPECIFICATION
-----------------------

LAYOUT: Bento Grid
  - Each category renders as a full-width section
  - Cards within a category are displayed in a horizontal carousel
  - Carousels use shadcn/ui Carousel component (CarouselContent, 
    CarouselItem, CarouselNext, CarouselPrevious)
  - Cards are sized consistently: basis-[280px] or similar fixed width
  - Featured cards can be slightly larger or have a distinct border

THEME: Dark Premium Glassmorphism
  - Page background: gradient from #070b16 via #0c1222 to #070b16
  - Card backgrounds: bg-white/[0.03] or bg-white/[0.04] with 
    backdrop-blur-xl
  - Borders: border-white/5 or border-white/10 (subtle glass edges)
  - Text: white for headings, white/70 for descriptions, white/40 for 
    secondary text
  - All cards have rounded-2xl corners
  - Hover effects: scale-[1.03] with transition-all duration-300

CARD DESIGN:
  - Background image fills the card with object-cover
  - Dark gradient overlay on images: bg-gradient-to-t from-black/90 
    via-black/60 to-black/30
  - Image has brightness-110 filter for vibrancy
  - Icon sits in a small rounded container with category-colored 
    gradient background
  - Glow effect: colored shadow on hover matching the card's glowColor
  - Badge (if present): small pill in top-right corner with gradient 
    background, e.g., bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-rose-500
  - Featured cards: slightly larger, distinct border glow, or a 
    "featured" indicator

STICKY HEADER:
  - Fixed at top with backdrop-blur-xl and bg-[#070b16]/80
  - Contains: Back arrow, platform logo/name, user greeting, logout button
  - Border-bottom: border-white/5

CATEGORY SECTIONS:
  - Each section has:
    * Category icon in a gradient-colored rounded container
    * Category title in bold white text
    * Category description in white/50 text (2-3 sentences)
    * Horizontal carousel of cards below
  - Sections are separated by generous spacing (space-y-10 or similar)

ANIMATIONS (Framer Motion):
  - Page entrance: cards fade in with staggered delays
  - Cards: initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }} animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  - Hover: scale up slightly with smooth transition
  - Category headers: subtle fade-in on scroll

RESPONSIVE / MOBILE:
  - Mobile-first design
  - Carousels scroll horizontally on touch devices
  - Cards stack naturally on small screens
  - Sticky header adapts (smaller text, compact layout)
  - Touch-friendly tap targets (min 44px)

=============================================================================

AUTHENTICATION FLOW
-------------------
1. Page loads with a skeleton loader (animated pulse placeholders)
2. Checks if user is authenticated (via auth context, JWT, session, etc.)
3. If NOT authenticated: shows a login form
   - Can be PIN-based (like ours), password, OAuth, etc.
   - Login form should match the dark glassmorphism theme
   - On success: stores auth state and reveals the command center
4. If authenticated: renders the full command center immediately
5. Logout button in header clears auth state and redirects

=============================================================================

IMAGES
------
- Every card MUST have a photorealistic background image
- No blank cards with just text — every card needs visual interest
- Images should be subject-matter relevant:
  * An "Analytics" card should show dashboards/charts
  * A "Users" card should show people/profiles
  * A "Settings" card should show gear/configuration imagery
- Images are imported as static assets (Vite import)
- Apply brightness-110 CSS filter for vibrancy
- Dark gradient overlay ensures text readability over any image

=============================================================================

=============================================================================

EXAMPLE: MINIMAL CATEGORY DEFINITION
-------------------------------------

const categories = [
  {
    title: "Dashboard",
    icon: <LayoutGrid className="size-4" />,
    gradient: "from-blue-500 to-cyan-500",
    description: "Your main overview tools. See real-time metrics, 
                  manage daily operations, and monitor system health.",
    cards: [
      { 
        label: "Overview", 
        description: "Real-time platform metrics", 
        href: "/admin/overview", 
        icon: <BarChart3 className="size-5" />, 
        image: overviewImg, 
        glowColor: "shadow-blue-500/20", 
        badge: "Live", 
        featured: true 
      },
      { 
        label: "System Health", 
        description: "Server status & uptime", 
        href: "/admin/health", 
        icon: <Server className="size-5" />, 
        image: healthImg, 
        glowColor: "shadow-green-500/20" 
      },
    ]
  },
  // ... more categories
];

=============================================================================

KEY PRINCIPLES
--------------
1. ONE PAGE TO RULE THEM ALL — every admin tool is accessible from here
2. VISUAL FIRST — photorealistic images, not plain text lists
3. CATEGORIZED — logical groupings so nothing feels overwhelming
4. PREMIUM FEEL — glassmorphism, glow effects, smooth animations
5. MOBILE READY — works on phones, tablets, and desktops
6. PROTECTED — authentication required, no public access
7. SELF-DOCUMENTING — category descriptions explain what each section does
8. EXTENSIBLE — adding a new tool = adding one card object to a category
