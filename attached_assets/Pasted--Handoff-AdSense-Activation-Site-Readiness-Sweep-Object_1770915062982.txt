📦 Handoff: AdSense Activation & Site Readiness Sweep
Objective: Move all domains from “Getting ready” to “Ready” and enable active ad serving across all properties.

1. Primary Blocker (Must Fix First)
All domains currently show:

Status: Getting ready

ads.txt: Not found

Google will not activate ad serving until ads.txt is correctly installed and detected.

2. Required Actions (Per Domain)
Perform these steps for each domain:

garagebot.io

darkwavestudios.io

happyeats.app

tldriverconnect.com

A. Create ads.txt file
File contents must be:

Code
google.com, ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
Replace ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with the correct publisher ID.

B. Upload ads.txt to the root directory
The file must resolve publicly at:

Code
https://DOMAIN/ads.txt
Verify by visiting the URL in a browser.

C. Confirm HTTPS accessibility
Google will not detect the file if:

Redirect loops exist

The file is behind auth

The file is served from a subdirectory

3. AdSense Dashboard Tasks
A. Re-check site status
After ads.txt is live, return to:

AdSense → Sites

Confirm each domain transitions from:

Getting ready → Ready

This may take 1–12 hours.

B. Enable Auto Ads
Once a domain shows Ready:

Go to Ads → Your sites

Select the domain

Toggle Auto ads → ON

Save

Auto Ads must be ON for Google to begin serving ads unless manual ad units are placed.

4. Verification Checklist (Agent Must Complete)
A. ads.txt
[ ] File exists at root

[ ] File contains correct publisher ID

[ ] File is publicly accessible

[ ] No redirects or 404s

B. AdSense Dashboard
[ ] Domain status = Ready

[ ] Auto Ads = ON

[ ] No policy violations

[ ] No “Needs attention” flags

C. Site Code
[ ] Global AdSense script is present in <head>

[ ] Script uses correct client ID

[ ] No CSP rules blocking Google scripts

5. Expected Outcome
Once ads.txt is detected and Auto Ads is enabled:

Google will activate ad serving

Ads begin appearing within 10 minutes to 24 hours

Full propagation may take up to 48 hours

6. Notes for Agent
Do not modify site code unless instructed

Do not create manual ad units unless requested

The only required tasks are:

Fix ads.txt

Verify domain readiness
