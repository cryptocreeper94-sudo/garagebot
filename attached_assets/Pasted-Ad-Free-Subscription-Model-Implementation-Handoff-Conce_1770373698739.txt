Ad-Free Subscription Model - Implementation Handoff
Concept
Add Google AdSense to TL Driver Connect (and potentially other ecosystem service apps) with a $5/month "Ad-Free" subscription upgrade per individual account. This creates a freemium revenue layer on top of existing app functionality.

Strategy
Trust Layer Portal (dwsc.io): NO ads. This is institutional-grade financial infrastructure. Ads undermine investor/enterprise credibility.
DarkWave Studios (darkwavestudios.io): Already has AdSense. Keep as-is.
GarageBot (garagebot.io): Already has AdSense. Keep as-is.
TL Driver Connect (HappyEats.app / TLDriverConnect.com): Add AdSense + $5/month ad-free tier.
Other ecosystem service apps: Same model can be replicated on any non-financial app (Orby, PaintPros, Brew & Board, etc.)
Implementation Steps
1. Google AdSense Integration
Add the AdSense script tag to the app's HTML head:
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
Place ad units in natural locations: between content sections, sidebar, footer area
Use responsive ad units so they work on mobile-first layouts
Avoid placing ads on login/signup/payment flows
2. Ad-Free Subscription ($5/month)
Create a Stripe subscription product: "Ad-Free Experience" at $5.00/month
Store subscription status on the user record (e.g., adFreeSubscription: boolean, adFreeExpiresAt: timestamp)
Use Stripe webhooks to handle: checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.deleted, invoice.payment_failed
3. Conditional Ad Rendering
// Wrap all ad placements in a conditional component
function AdUnit({ slot, format = "auto" }: { slot: string; format?: string }) {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  // Don't render ads for ad-free subscribers
  if (user?.adFreeSubscription) return null;
  
  return (
    <ins className="adsbygoogle"
      style={{ display: "block" }}
      data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
      data-ad-slot={slot}
      data-ad-format={format}
      data-full-width-responsive="true" />
  );
}
4. Cross-App Option (via Trust Layer Ecosystem Sync)
If you want the $5/month subscription purchased on Trust Layer to remove ads across ALL ecosystem apps:

Use the existing Ecosystem Credential Sync system (POST /api/ecosystem/verify-credentials)
Add a new endpoint: GET /api/ecosystem/subscription-status?email=user@example.com
Ecosystem apps call Trust Layer to check if the user has an active ad-free subscription
Secured with existing HMAC-SHA256 signed requests using each app's dw_* API keys
Reference: docs/GARAGEBOT-CREDENTIAL-SYNC-HANDOFF.md for the existing sync pattern
5. User Experience
Show a subtle "Go Ad-Free for $5/mo" banner or button near ad placements
After subscribing, ads disappear immediately (no page refresh needed if using React state)
Include ad-free status on the user's account/settings page
Cancellation returns ads at end of billing period
Key Decisions
$5/month per individual account (not per app - one subscription removes ads everywhere)
Stripe handles billing, webhooks handle status changes
Trust Layer is the single source of truth for subscription status
Each ecosystem app checks subscription status via the Ecosystem Sync API
Revenue Model
AdSense revenue from free-tier users
$5/month recurring from users who upgrade
Both revenue streams compound as more ecosystem apps adopt the model
