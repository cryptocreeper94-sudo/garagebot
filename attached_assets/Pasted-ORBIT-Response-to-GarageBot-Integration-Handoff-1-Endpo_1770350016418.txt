ORBIT Response to GarageBot Integration Handoff

1. Endpoints - All LIVE (13 total)

All 13 ecosystem endpoints are live and accepting requests at https://orbitstaffing.io:

Endpoint	Status
GET /api/ecosystem/status	LIVE
POST /api/ecosystem/sync/contractors	LIVE
POST /api/ecosystem/sync/workers	LIVE
POST /api/ecosystem/sync/timesheets	LIVE
POST /api/ecosystem/sync/1099	LIVE
POST /api/ecosystem/sync/w2	LIVE
POST /api/ecosystem/sync/certifications	LIVE
GET /api/ecosystem/shops/{shopId}/workers	LIVE
GET /api/ecosystem/shops/{shopId}/payroll	LIVE
GET/POST /api/ecosystem/logs	LIVE
GET/POST /api/ecosystem/snippets	LIVE
2. Authentication - CORRECTIONS NEEDED

ORBIT uses two headers for ecosystem auth, not HMAC:

X-API-Key — the app's API key
X-API-Secret — the raw API secret (ORBIT hashes it server-side with SHA256 and compares)
GarageBot can remove these extra headers (they're ignored):

X-Timestamp (not used)
X-Signature (not used on ecosystem endpoints)
X-App-Name (not used)
GarageBot IS registered and active. API key: dw_app_3c88bda688e781b58b2b46144bf6006a49add5c28eed327e

3. Status Response Format - CORRECTION

GarageBot expects { version, registered } but ORBIT returns:

{
  "connected": true,
  "hubName": "ORBIT Staffing Ecosystem Hub",
  "appName": "GarageBot",
  "permissions": ["read:workers", "write:workers", ...],
  "lastSync": null
}
Adjust your status check accordingly.

4. Financial Hub Endpoint - CORRECTION

The endpoint is /api/financial-hub/ingest — NOT /api/financial-hub/events.

Different auth headers for Financial Hub:

X-Orbit-Api-Key — the Financial Hub API key
X-Orbit-Signature — HMAC-SHA256 of the request body
GarageBot would need separate Financial Hub credentials (registered through the ORBIT Financial Hub partner system, separate from the ecosystem).

5. Webhooks (ORBIT -> GarageBot)

Outbound webhooks are not currently implemented. This is a future feature. For now, GarageBot should poll the ecosystem endpoints for updates.

6. Shop Provisioning

Option A is not available yet. Shops are currently managed through the ORBIT admin dashboard. For launch, GarageBot should sync worker/contractor/timesheet data for shops, and ORBIT will store it under the shopId (tenantId) that GarageBot provides.

7. Payroll Capabilities

ORBIT is currently a record-keeping and compliance tracking system — it tracks W-2 and 1099 records, calculates royalty splits, and generates blockchain-stamped financial statements. Actual payroll processing (direct deposits, tax filings, W-2 generation) would need integration with a processor like Gusto or ADP. That can be added later.

8. Production Database

GarageBot's credentials need to be inserted into the production database. The dev registration is confirmed, but publishing only pushes code — not data. GarageBot's production INSERT:

INSERT INTO ecosystem_connected_apps (id, app_name, app_slug, api_key, api_secret_hash, permissions, is_active)
VALUES (
  'f2fcc14f-445e-47f7-a9a5-c51870c55106',
  'GarageBot', 'garagebot',
  'dw_app_3c88bda688e781b58b2b46144bf6006a49add5c28eed327e',
  'f54c812dfa512da955d7af8e94f719159c01bf5dc2b0ec23a2710ac98f09daeb',
  '{read:workers,write:workers,read:contractors,write:contractors,read:1099,write:1099,read:timesheets,write:timesheets,read:certifications,write:certifications,read:code,write:code}',
  true
);
You'll need to run this in the production database after the next publish.

Summary: What GarageBot needs to fix on their side:

Remove X-Timestamp, X-Signature, X-App-Name headers (or leave them — they're just ignored)
Change Financial Hub endpoint from /events to /ingest
Use different auth headers for Financial Hub vs Ecosystem
Update status check to expect ORBIT's actual response format
Use polling instead of webhooks for now
Everything else is ready. Once you run that production INSERT, GarageBot can start calling all endpoints.
