# PartScout Business Plan

## Executive Summary
PartScout is a next-generation auto parts aggregator designed to solve the fragmentation in the automotive aftermarket. By unifying inventory from major retailers (AutoZone, O'Reilly, etc.), online giants (RockAuto, Amazon), and specialty shops into a single "Time + Price" optimization engine, PartScout empowers users to find the exact part they need at the best total cost of ownership (price + shipping + time).

## Core Value Proposition
*   **Time + Price Optimization:** We don't just find the cheapest part; we find the best balance of cost and speed (e.g., "Get it now for $60" vs. "Get it in 2 days for $40").
*   **Hybrid Fulfillment:** Prioritizing local pickup for immediate needs while offering shipping options for cost savings.
*   **Tech-Forward Experience:** A sleek, modern interface that appeals to both younger enthusiasts and seasoned mechanics.

## Revenue Models
1.  **Affiliate Commission:** Earn 5-8% on referrals to partner retailers.
2.  **Premium Membership ($9.99/mo):**
    *   Real-time Price Drop Alerts.
    *   Advanced Wishlist & Project Tracking.
    *   Warranty Tracking & Management.
3.  **Direct Sales (Future):** Integrated checkout via Stripe, capturing a margin on select inventory.
4.  **B2B Fleet Management:** Subscription tools for mechanics to manage bulk orders and fleet maintenance.
5.  **Crypto Payments:** leverage Coinbase Commerce to attract crypto-native users.

## Market Strategy
*   **Target Audience:** DIY Enthusiasts, Professional Mechanics, Fleet Managers.
*   **Growth Channels:** SEO (Programmatic pages for part numbers), Influencer Partnerships (YouTube Build Guides), Community Building.

## Competitive Advantage
*   **Local Inventory Visibility:** Real-time stock status at nearby physical stores.
*   **Cross-Platform Presence:** Seamless experience across Web and Native Mobile Apps (planned).
*   **Modern UX:** Breaking away from the dated, clunky interfaces of traditional parts retailers.
